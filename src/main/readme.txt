Our game start by running the Homepage class. When Homepage class is run, it shows two options,play and
quit. On pressing play button, it will redirect you to the game page. On game page, you can start playing the game.
Our game has all the required functionalities. While moving, the player can pick cherries. If the number of cherry
count is greater than or equal to 2, on falling down, the player is revived and the game again continues to run. On
the game page, we have pause button to pause the game when required. Clicking on pause button will redirect you to
pause page, which has three buttons, resume, save and exit. On clicking resume, game resumes. On clicking save,
game gets saved, and clicking on exit will redirect you to home page. On home page, you have load button to load
your saved game. We have used proper animations in our game to give a more exciting experience in our game. Pillars
are being generated by use of random_gen. We have also created JUnit test files to test our classes for different
inputs.
We have used multi-threading to check the position of player and consecutive cherry , at every step.This is done so
that even when the main application is running , we can keep track of the location of player and cherry.
We also tried our best to put media and sound track in our game. However, due to compatibility issue and lack of
time, we couldn't implement it. However, we have wrote the code of it in a function named music() in HelloApplication
class. Plz evaluate it if possible.
Thank you
